# Deep Reinforcement Learning Project Report: DDPG Implementation for Reacher Environment

## 1. Algorithm and Problem Review

### Problem Definition
The project implements a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm to solve the Reacher environment, where a robotic arm needs to reach and maintain position at target locations. The environment provides:
- State space: 33 dimensions representing position, rotation, velocity, and angular velocities
- Action space: 4 continuous actions controlling torque at joints
- Reward structure: +0.1 for each step the agent's hand is in the goal location

### Algorithm Selection
DDPG was chosen because:
- It handles continuous action spaces effectively
- Combines the advantages of both DQN and policy gradient methods
- Uses actor-critic architecture for stable learning
- Employs deterministic policy for efficient learning in continuous action spaces

## 2. Environment Setup

The project uses Unity ML-Agents framework with the following components:
- Unity Reacher environment for simulation
- PyTorch for neural network implementation
- Custom implementation of replay buffer and noise processes
- Testing framework for evaluating agent performance

## 3. Algorithm Implementation

### Architecture Overview

#### Actor Network
- 6-layer neural network architecture:
- Input layer (33 states) → 256 → 128 → 64 → 32 → 16 → Output layer (4 actions)
- ReLU activation for hidden layers
- tanh activation for output layer
- Initialized with uniform distribution based on input size

#### Critic Network
- Similar 6-layer architecture with action injection:
- Input layer (33 states) → 256 → Concatenate with actions → 128 → 64 → 32 → 16 → 1
- ReLU activation for hidden layers
- No activation for output layer

### Key Components

#### Experience Replay
- Buffer size: 1e6
- Batch size: 1024
- Randomly samples experiences for training
- Stores state, action, reward, next_state, and done flags

#### Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Noise Process
- Implements temporal correlation for exploration
- Parameters:
  - θ (theta) = 0.15
  - σ (sigma) = 0.2
  - μ (mu) = 0.0

#### Learning Parameters
- Actor learning rate: 1e-4
- Critic learning rate: 1e-3
- Discount factor (gamma): 0.99
- Soft update parameter (tau): 1e-3
- No weight decay for optimization

## 4. Training and Testing

### Training Process
- Episodes run until environment is solved
- Each episode collects experiences and performs learning steps
- Soft updates target networks for stability
- Tracks average scores over 100 episodes

### Testing Implementation
- Loads trained model weights
- Runs 5 test episodes
- Disables exploration noise
- Visual rendering enabled for observation
- Implements error handling and cleanup

## 5. Performance Optimization

### Hyperparameter Tuning
- Increased batch size to 1024 for more stable learning
- Adjusted network architecture with gradually decreasing layer sizes
- Fine-tuned noise parameters for better exploration
- Implemented proper initialization for network layers

### Architecture Decisions
- Deep network (6 layers) to capture complex dynamics
- Gradually decreasing layer sizes to avoid overfitting
- Action injection in critic's second layer for better value estimation

## 6. Results Analysis
